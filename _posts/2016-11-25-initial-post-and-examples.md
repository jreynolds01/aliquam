Thanks to the gloriousness that is github pages, I have started this blog. At this point, the goal of the blog is to 
discuss topics about how data analysis can really benefit various aspects of our lives - My intent is to focus on topics 
that impact mental and physical health, such as nutrition and fitness, but other topics may come up as well... For instance, 
the use of a simple quantitive measure of "efficiency gap" recently made a lot of news in a case in Wisconsin, and could have 
very far-reaching consequences for gerrymandering. Check out this [post](http://election.princeton.edu/2016/11/24/a-lower-
court-win-on-partisan-gerrymandering/) to see some additional commentary and some potential issues and proposed solutions.

I'm still in the process of organizing things now, but I want to also acknowledge those that have helped get it started.

I love markdown, and markdown + git + jekyll are currently blowing my mind. Thanks to 
[Micheleen Harris](https://michhar.github.io) for introducing me to jekyll. I'm shamelessly 
starting with the same theme that she uses - [aliquam](https://github.com/grrinchas/aliquam).
