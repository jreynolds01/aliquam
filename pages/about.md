I am currently a Senior Data Scientist Lead in the Algorithms and Data Science group at Microsoft. I currently lead a team of 
data scientists and trainers who help enable our partners to build world-class solutions on our analytics tool stacks. Prior 
to joining Microsoft, I worked for Revolution Analytics, where I helped our customers learn to use both open source R and 
(what is now) Microsoft R.

Prior to joining industry, I was an NIMH-funded, tenure-track professor at the University of Denver, and I studied the 
computational and neural mechanisms of controlled behavior.
